# 👻 My Favorite Movie: Incantation

**Incantation** is a Taiwanese supernatural horror film released in 2022. I found it to be one of the scariest found-footage movies in recent years.

## Elements I Loved

* **Plot:** The story uses a documentary style and addresses deep cultural fears.
* **Narrative Technique:** It uses the concept of 'viewer participation' to great effect.
* **Unsettling Atmosphere:** The movie maintains a feeling of dread without relying only on jump scares.
